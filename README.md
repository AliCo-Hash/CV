## Ali Cocelli

I am a junior full stack developer and a recent graduate from Makers Academy. I've always had an interest in tech from building my first pc to building my first keyboard. My interest in tech grew further when I undertook a public key cryptography project and doing a module in computational mathematics.

## Skills

<kbd>**Fast Learner**</kbd>

In the course of the Maker-Mate project, I was able to wrap my head around MongoDB and Express within the first week without it being taught during the course. This meant that I was able to make good headway during the project allowing me to implement React towards the end of the first week. Whilst working at my previous job I was able to pick up the methodology to dispense a tailor made lens, in a day, enabling me to be the only person in the store that was capable of dispensing this unique lens aside from the optometrist.

<kbd>**Great Communicator**</kbd>

During the past decade I have been teaching in one way or another be it in a classroom or onsite training. My ability to break down complex concepts into digestible chunks and taking a step by step approach to problem solving allows me to explain techniques and their practical application. During the stand-ups/meetings where I had learnt and used React I was able to demonstrate how a React hook is used and applied to the project allowing my team to gain that skill and apply it themselves.

<kbd>**Analytical thinking**</kbd>

The escape room project required creative solutions to implement the different elements of the game. By considering the multi-functional aspects of each element and breaking these down to different steps I was able to create an interactive item that incorporated hooks, promises, conditionals.
