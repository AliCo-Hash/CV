## Ali Cocelli

I am a junior full stack developer and a recent graduate from Makers Academy. I've always had an interest in tech from building my first pc to building my first keyboard. My interest in tech grew further when I undertook a public key cryptography project and doing a module in computational mathematics.

## Skills

<kbd>**Fast Learner**</kbd>

In the course of the Maker-Mate project, I was able to wrap my head around MongoDB and Express within the first week without it being taught during the course. This meant that I was able to make good headway during the project allowing me to implement React towards the end of the first week. Whilst working at my previous job I was able to pick up the methodology to dispense a tailor made lens, in a day, enabling me to be the only person in the store that was capable of dispensing this unique lens aside from the optometrist.

<kbd>**Great Communicator**</kbd>

During the past decade I have been teaching in one way or another be it in a classroom or onsite training. My ability to break down complex concepts into digestible chunks and taking a step by step approach to problem solving allows me to explain techniques and their practical application. During the stand-ups/meetings where I had learnt and used React I was able to demonstrate how a React hook is used and applied to the project allowing my team to gain that skill and apply it themselves.

<kbd>**Analytical thinking**</kbd>

The escape room project required creative solutions to implement the different elements of the game. By considering the multi-functional aspects of each element and breaking these down to different steps I was able to create an interactive item that incorporated hooks, promises, conditionals.

## Work Experience

#### **Vision Express(Tesco Opticians)** (September 2017 to September 2021)

Optical Assistant

- Worked as part of a team with optometrists, dispensing opticians and optical assistants in providing care and assistance to patients and customers which involved good communication skills and being able to recall the needs and requests of multiple individuals at any given time.
- Stayed up to date with lens technologies, including contact lenses, which enabled me to provide appropriate evidenced-basis advice and problem solving for patients and customers.
- Took sole responsibility for opening and closing the store (including setting up the tills and end of day cashing and reporting), which involved time management and attention to detail.

#### **Haringey Sixth Form College** (September 2011 to July 2012)

Volunteer Assistant Teacher

- Taught advanced methods in Mathematics to a higher ability A2 class, allowing me to adapt to their needs and create an optimal learning environment.
- Assisted and encouraged struggling students by using my creativity to highlight key points and proceed to simplify methods.
- Used my initiative to establish hour-long weekly workshops and offer daily tuition, which helped in achieving on average higher grades.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (December 2021 to April 2022)

- Utilising pair-programming with my communication skills on a frequent basis with various different cohort members in order to positively promote good workflow.
- Rapid learning of multiple technologies during the final project to meet the demand of changing scenarios, and adapt to the needs of the project.
- Carrying-out weekend challenges using what was learned throughout the week in order to further test and progress of my knowledge.
- Completing group projects by working effectively as a team to find innovative solutions to enable each team member to successfully complete their individual tasks.

#### University of Kent September 2012 - June 2016

- Bsc in Mathematics
- Project on public-key cryptography

#### Haringey Sixth Form College

A levels: Mathematics(A), Accounting(B), Business (C)
AS levels: Further Mathematics(B)

## Hobbies/Interests
